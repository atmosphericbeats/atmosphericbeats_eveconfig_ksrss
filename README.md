What does it do?

Earth
- Adapted from Kerbin stock config
- More realistic cloud thickness and altitude on Earth, compared to thin cloud layers on stock eve configs
- Smoother fade to ScaledSpace to avoid flat carpet of clouds when watching from high altitudes/orbit
- Reduced NoiseAnimation to avoid unrealistic clouds movements when timewarping from high altitudes/orbit

Mars
- Adapted from Duna stock config
- Adjusted dust storms thickness and altitude
- Adjusted cirrus-like clouds thickness
- Smoother fade to ScaledSpace to avoid unrealistic dust storms pattern from orbit

Venus
- Adapted from Eve stock config
- Adjusted clouds and fog thickness and altitude

Titan (Experimental)
- Uniform fog layer that can be seen from orbit
- Methane clouds and rain
- Some glitch are possible, as it is difficult to keep a good interaction between the fog layer and the CH4 cloud layer. Please consider it as unfinished
